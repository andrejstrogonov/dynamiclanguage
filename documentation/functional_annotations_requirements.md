# Functional Requirements for Map, Reduce, Filter Annotations in Java

## Overview
The purpose of `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` annotations is to streamline functional programming paradigms within Java, enhancing the ability to process collections with declarative style.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Definition
#### Map Annotation
- The `@Map` annotation shall be defined in the `com.example.annotations` package.
- This annotation is marked with `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` and `@Target({ElementType.METHOD})`.

#### Reduce Annotation
- The `@Reduce` annotation shall reside in the `com.example.annotations` package.
- Defined similarly with `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` and `@Target({ElementType.METHOD})`.

#### Filter Annotation
- The `@Filter` annotation is placed in the `com.example.annotations` package.
- Like others, it uses `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` and `@Target({ElementType.METHOD})`.

### 2. Usage
- **Map**: Should be applicable to methods that transform each element of a collection into another form.
- **Reduce**: Applied to methods that combine elements of a collection into a single outcome, typically utilizing some accumulator.
- **Filter**: Used in methods to remove elements of a collection that do not meet specified conditions.

### 3. Behavior
- Collect data using streams or collections wrapped with these annotations.
- Automatically optimize the associated method for parallel execution when feasible.
- Enable chaining of methods marked by these annotations.

### 4. Constraints
- Must handle generic types effectively, ensuring type safety and compatibility.
- Should not be applied to methods that alter the state of elements in place (non-functional behavior).
- Requires exception handling for any runtime failures due to annotation misapplications.

### 5. Error Handling
- Compile-time warnings if annotations are applied to non-functional methods or those with side effects.
- Runtime exception handling for errors during data transformation or reduction.

### 6. Maintainability
- Annotations should include metadata support for documentation, providing usage information for JavaDoc.
- Metadata should facilitate easy identification of methods involved in functional chaining and modifications.
