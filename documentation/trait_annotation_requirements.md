# Functional Requirements for `@Trait` Annotation in Java

## Overview
The `@Trait` annotation allows Java developers to mark interfaces or classes with a specific trait characteristic, leading to clear and organized code behavior similar to traits in other programming languages.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Definition
- The `@Trait` annotation shall be defined in a package named `com.example.annotations`.
- It should be annotated with `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`, allowing it to retain at runtime.
- It shall also be annotated with `@Target({ElementType.TYPE})`, restricting its use to class, interface, or enum types.

### 2. Usage
- The `@Trait` annotation shall be applicable to interfaces and classes that can be considered traits.
- The annotation can be used to group multiple traits via a separate marker annotation (e.g., `@Traits`).

### 3. Behavior
- When a class is annotated with `@Trait`, it should enable the composition of methods from multiple interfaces, mimicking the behavior of traits.
- The system shall not alter the inheritance hierarchy, ensuring it remains single-inheritance while allowing multiple traits.

### 4. Constraints
- The `@Trait` annotation will not be compatible with abstract classes; it should only be used with concrete classes or interfaces.
- It must be used in a context where the traits can be logically and structurally composed without causing conflicts in method resolution.

### 5. Error Handling
- If the `@Trait` annotation is misapplied to an abstract class, the compiler should issue a warning.
- There should be a mechanism to detect and report method conflicts where two traits provide the same method signature with different implementations.

### 6. Maintainability
- Annotations using `@Trait` should support documentation through Javadoc, ensuring that traits' purpose and usage are well-documented and maintained over time.
