The approach would involve creating a Python runtime in Java where:

	1. Java Annotations would be used to define Python-specific behaviors:


		* @PythonClass
		* @PythonMethod
		* @PythonDynamic
		* @PythonImport
	2. The Reflection API would enable:


		* Dynamic method invocation
		* Runtime type inspection
		* Dynamic class loading
		* Attribute access patterns similar to Python
	3. Implementation strategy:


		* Parse Python syntax into an AST
		* Transform Python code into annotated Java classes
		* Use reflection to implement Python's dynamic behaviors like duck typing
		* Implement Python's builtin types as Java wrapper classes
		* Use reflection to handle Python's attribute lookup and method resolution
	4. Core challenges to address:


		* Python's dynamic typing vs Java's static typing
		* Implementing Python's "everything is an object" model
		* Supporting Python's module system
		* Implementing Python's metaprogramming features
