# Functional Requirements for `@Fork` Annotation in Java

## Overview
The `@Fork` annotation is designed to mark methods or classes that should execute distinct paths or parallel processes, enhancing the flexibility and modularity of code by similar means to process forks in operating systems.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Definition
- The `@Fork` annotation shall be defined in a package named `com.example.annotations`.
- It should be annotated with `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`, allowing it to retain at runtime.
- It shall also be annotated with `@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})`, making it applicable to both methods and class types.

### 2. Usage
- The `@Fork` annotation shall be applicable to methods or classes that need to initiate separate or parallel execution paths.
- When used at the class level, it implies that every public method in the class is subject to separate execution paths unless specified otherwise.

### 3. Behavior
- Methods or classes marked with `@Fork` should be able to execute as separate threads or processes, emulating the concept of process forking.
- The system should handle concurrency issues automatically, ensuring thread safety where applicable.

### 4. Constraints
- The `@Fork` annotation will not support primitive data types for return values when applied to methods, ensuring that forked processes can be managed and results can be aggregated.
- It is not compatible with methods that have synchronized blocks, unless explicitly handled by the user.

### 5. Error Handling
- If the `@Fork` annotation is applied to a synchronized method without proper concurrency management, the compiler should issue a warning.
- There should be a built-in mechanism to handle exceptions arising from parallel processing, ensuring no loss of information or system crashes.

### 6. Maintainability
- Documentation should be provided for the use of the `@Fork` annotation through Javadoc, ensuring developers understand its usage and constraints for maintenance purposes.
