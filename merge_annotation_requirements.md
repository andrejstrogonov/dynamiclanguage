# Functional Requirements for `@org.andreistrogonov.annotations.Merge` Annotation in Java

## Overview
The `@org.andreistrogonov.annotations.Merge` annotation is intended to unify or combine the outputs or state of multiple program elements, enhancing the ability to aggregate results within Java programs in a structured and efficient manner.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Definition
- The `@org.andreistrogonov.annotations.Merge` annotation shall be defined in the `com.example.annotations` package.
- It should be annotated with `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`, allowing it to be retained at runtime.
- It shall also be annotated with `@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD})`, allowing it to be applied to both methods and fields.

### 2. Usage
- The `@org.andreistrogonov.annotations.Merge` annotation is applicable to methods and fields that are intended to combine data from multiple sources.
- Methods annotated with `@org.andreistrogonov.annotations.Merge` should implement logic to effectively aggregate data, either from different method calls or external inputs.

### 3. Behavior
- The system should automatically handle the aggregation logic, ensuring that merging operations are thread-safe and consistent.
- Methods or fields marked with `@org.andreistrogonov.annotations.Merge` should support both synchronous and asynchronous merging, depending on the context of their use.

### 4. Constraints
- The `@org.andreistrogonov.annotations.Merge` annotation will not support primitive data types directly unless wrapped or extended via an object-oriented approach.
- It should not be applied to methods or fields that are expected to alter their internal state outside the defined merging process.

### 5. Error Handling
- During compilation, warnings should be issued if `@org.andreistrogonov.annotations.Merge` is applied to methods that inherently produce non-deterministic results.
- There should be a mechanism to manage exceptions arising from inconsistent input data or failed merge operations.

### 6. Maintainability
- The `@org.andreistrogonov.annotations.Merge` annotation should be well-documented using Javadoc, providing clear guidelines for its intended use, constraints, and examples to ensure smooth adoption and understanding by developers.
