# Functional Requirements for `@Async` and `@Await` Annotations in Java

## Overview
The `@Async` and `@Await` annotations aim to provide a more concise and manageable way to handle asynchronous programming in Java. These annotations are meant to simplify asynchronous code execution and make async logic easier to write, understand, and maintain.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Definition
- The `@Async` and `@Await` annotations shall be defined within the `com.example.asyncannotations` package.
- The `@Async` annotation applies to methods initiating asynchronous operations.
- The `@Await` annotation will be utilized where the completion of asynchronous operations needs to be awaited.

### 2. Usage
#### `@Async`
- The `@Async` annotation is intended to mark methods that need to be executed asynchronously.
- Methods annotated with `@Async` should automatically run in a separate thread or task executor.

#### `@Await`
- The `@Await` annotation is suitable for method calls that must wait for asynchronous results.
- It indicates that the method execution should pause until the async process completes.

### 3. Behavior
#### Asynchronous Execution
- Methods annotated with `@Async` will not block the calling thread. Instead, they should proceed immediately and complete their tasks on a separate thread.
- Any long-running tasks or I/O operations should be deferred to `@Async` methods.

#### Awaiting Completion
- When a method or call site is annotated with `@Await`, the execution should suspend until the asynchronous operation indicated completes.
- The system should ensure that all underlying promises or futures are appropriately handled and resolved.

### 4. Constraints
- The `@Async` and `@Await` annotations should work seamlessly on methods having CompletableFuture or similar async return types.
- These annotations should not interfere with synchronous methods and must be applied only where necessary.

### 5. Error Handling
- Adequate exception handling must be integrated, especially when `@Await` fails to obtain a result due to errors in asynchronous execution.
- Logging and error propagation mechanisms should be implemented to facilitate debugging of async operations.

### 6. Maintainability
- Detailed documentation and examples must accompany the introduction of these annotations to guide developers in adopting these features.
- Tools to analyze dependencies and execution flow in asynchronous logic should be provided to ensure code readability and maintainability.
